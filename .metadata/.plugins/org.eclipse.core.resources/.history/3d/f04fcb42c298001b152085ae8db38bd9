/**
 * Contains the API necessary for a simple, (optionally) weighted directed graph.
 * We call the graph "optionally weighted" because it can be used by algorithms that use weights
 * (like Dijkstra's) and by algorithms that do not (like BFS). An algorithm like BFS would simply
 * ignore any weights present.
 * <p>
 * By convention, the n vertices will be labeled 0,1,...,n-1. The edge weights can be any int value.
 * Since we are labeling vertices from 0 to n-1, you may find arrays/arraylists helpful!
 * Self loops and parallel edges are not allowed. Your implementation should use O(m + n) space.
 * Please DO NOT use adjacency matrices!
 * <p>
 * Also note that the runtimes given are expected runtimes. As a result, you should be
 * implementing your graph using a HashMap as the primary data structure for the adjacency list.
 * <p>
 * Notice that this class also supports undirected graph. Which means you can implement an
 * undirected graph as each undirected edge between u and v being two directed edge from u to v and
 * from v to u.
